# Ruby Environment Setup Summary

The Learn IDE creates a development environment that runs on a remote server. This means that you can see the output of executing your code on a different machine.

If you're on a Mac and would like to actually setup your local environment, follow the instructions at http://help.learn.co/technical-support/local-environment/mac-osx-manual-environment-set-up

Note: If you get stuck or have any issues, never fear! You can continue to use the Learn IDE to complete the pre-work. Once you arrive on campus, an instructor can help you troubleshoot.
