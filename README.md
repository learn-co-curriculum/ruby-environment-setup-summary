# Ruby Environment Setup Summary

The Learn IDE creates a development environment that runs on a remote server. This means that you can see the output of executing your code on a different machine. For the in person portion of the program, you'll use a development environment that runs on your own laptop.

If you're on a Mac, set up your local environment by following the instructions at https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/environment-mac-os-catalina-setup

Note: If you get stuck or have any issues, never fear! You can continue to use the Learn IDE to complete the pre-work. Once you arrive on campus, an instructor can help you troubleshoot.
